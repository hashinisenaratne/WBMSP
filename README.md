This project was initialized as a supportive software project for the management of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board. The main objective of the project is to identify and improve possible areas of the Boardâ€™s functionality using a software approach.
This project was carried out under Object Oriented Software Development code in my 3rd semester with another 4 undergraduates.
